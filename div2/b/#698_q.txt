Nezzar's favorite digit among 1,…,9 is d. He calls a positive integer lucky if d occurs at least once in its decimal representation.

Given q integers a1,a2,…,aq, for each 1≤i≤q Nezzar would like to know if ai can be equal to a sum of several (one or more) lucky numbers.

Input
The first line contains a single integer t (1≤t≤9) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers q and d (1≤q≤104, 1≤d≤9).

The second line of each test case contains q integers a1,a2,…,aq (1≤ai≤109).

Output
For each integer in each test case, print "YES" in a single line if ai can be equal to a sum of lucky numbers. Otherwise, print "NO".

You can print letters in any case (upper or lower).
